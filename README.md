# Gym compendium

Gym compendium is a full stack application that uses Spring Boot and PostgreSQL on the backend and HTML,CSS and JavaScript on the frontend. It allows the user to search for a gym exercise to add to his workout schedule, based on the muscle trained and the equipment at his own disposal. The frontend sends a request to the API which fetches data from a local database. It then serves it in a JSON format back to the frontend.

What i've learned :

- Spring initializr
- Spring boot annotations
- Dependency injection pattern
- Spring application context and beans
- Database repository
- Basic use of jdbc template
